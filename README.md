## 📄 Reflection Questions & Answers

### 1️⃣ What is the difference between **padding** and **margin** in CSS?

**Answer:**

### 2️⃣ How does **font-family** influence the look of a webpage?

**Answer:**  
The `font-family` determines the **visual style and personality** of your text. It affects readability and overall user experience. For example, using a sans-serif font like Arial gives a modern feel, while a serif font adds a classic touch.

### 3️⃣ Why is it important to specify a **background-color** for elements in web design?

**Answer:**  
Background color enhances **contrast**, improves **readability**, and supports the visual design of the webpage. It also provides a fallback when background images fail to load and helps group content visually.

### 4️⃣ How did the **background-image** property change the visual appeal of your webpage?

**Answer:**  
A background image adds **visual depth** and **engagement**. It makes the page more aesthetically pleasing and can reflect the theme or purpose of the website more effectively than plain colors alone.
